# Civo Cloud

[In 2019 we went all in and took Civo in a new direction](https://www.civo.com/blog/a-civo-2019-retrospective-how-we-got-here-and-what-s-next), launching the worldâ€™s first k3s-powered, managed Kubernetes service into beta.

As a natural as it could be, we work perfectly on Civo so here it is the simples guide ever to run our k3ai on it.

Below is the guide that demonstrates running Kubeflow-Pipelines on Civo Cloud
