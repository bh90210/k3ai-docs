# Civo Cloud

[In 2019 we went all in and took Civo in a new direction](https://www.civo.com/blog/a-civo-2019-retrospective-how-we-got-here-and-what-s-next), launching the worldâ€™s first k3s-powered, managed Kubernetes service into beta.

### Step 2

Download the **kubeconfig** file,  move it to your preferred location, and set your environment to use it:
