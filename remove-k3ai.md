# Remove k3ai \(Work In Progress\)

We are working on this.

In the meantime just remove the cli from:

* **Linux/WSL**: `/usr/local/bin`
* **Windows**: `C:\Windows\System32`
* **Mac**: ideally you placed it in `/usr/local/bin` if not delete it from where you placed it.

Work in Progress \(do you like it? Let us know with an [**issue**](https://github.com/kf5i/k3ai-core/issues/new/choose)\)

In order to uninstall k3ai, we provide a simple command to remove all components. All you have to do is launch the following command:

```text
k3ai-cli delete
```
