# Argo Workflows

## Quick Start Guide

You only have to decide if you want **CPU** support:

```bash
k3ai-cli apply argo-workflow
```

### What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph \(DAG\).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
* Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.
