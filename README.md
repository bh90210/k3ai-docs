# K3ai \(keÉª3ai\)

K3ai is a lightweight infrastructure-in-a-box specifically built to install and configure AI tools and platforms to quickly experiment and/or run in production over edge devices.

## Ready to experiment?

We have a  utility script for you 

```text
curl -sfL https://get-core.k3ai.in | bash -
```

If for any reason it fails just go straight away to [https://github.com/kf5i/k3ai-core/releases](https://github.com/kf5i/k3ai-core/releases) and download the binary. Place it in your path and that's it.

 or use the following

```bash
#Set a variable to grab latest version
Version=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/kf5i/k3ai-core/releases/latest" | awk -F '"' '/tag_name/{print $4}' | cut -c 2-6) 
# get the binaries
wget https://github.com/kf5i/k3ai-core/releases/download/v$Version/k3ai-core_${Version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
